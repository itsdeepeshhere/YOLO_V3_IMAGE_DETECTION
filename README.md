YOLO - You Only Look Once

 The most salient feature of v3 is that it makes detections at three different scales. YOLO is a fully convolutional network and its eventual output is generated by applying a 1 x 1 kernel on a feature map. 
 In YOLO v3, the detection is done by applying 1 x 1 detection kernels on feature maps of three different sizes at three different places in the network.
 
 ###This repository contains the code for YOLO v3 Object detection, which can detect objects quickly. Images, movies, and webcam input feeds can all be used to provide input.
